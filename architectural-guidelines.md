# Architectural Guidelines for Copper Print Gallery System

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

- Follow a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct services.
- Use a consistent directory structure across all services.
- Implement a clean architecture pattern (e.g., layers for controllers, services, and data access).
- Keep business logic separate from framework-specific code.

## 2. Coding Standards

- Adhere to language-specific style guides (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, PEP 8 for Python).
- Use consistent naming conventions across all services (camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Include inline comments for complex logic, but prefer clear code over excessive comments.

## 3. API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for API design.
- Use versioning in API routes (e.g., /api/v1/...) to allow for future changes.
- Implement consistent error handling and response formats across all APIs.
- Use HTTP status codes appropriately.
- Document all APIs using a standard format (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

- Use Keycloak for centralized authentication and authorization.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) consistently across all services.
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- Never store sensitive information (passwords, tokens) in plain text.

## 5. Data Management

- Use database migrations for version control of database schemas.
- Implement data validation at both API and database levels.
- Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper indexing in the database for frequently accessed data.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement centralized error handling and logging.
- Use a consistent logging format across all services.
- Log all critical operations and errors.
- Implement different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and use them appropriately.

## 7. Testing

- Aim for high test coverage (suggest a minimum of 80%).
- Write unit tests for all business logic.
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
- Use mocking for external dependencies in unit tests.
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys.

## 8. Security

- Keep all dependencies up to date and regularly check for vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all system components.

## 9. Performance

- Implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed data).
- Use pagination for large data sets.
- Optimize database queries and use indexing effectively.
- Implement lazy loading for images in the frontend.

## 10. Scalability

- Design services to be stateless to allow for easy horizontal scaling.
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent environments and easy deployment.
- Implement health check endpoints for all services.
- Design with eventual consistency in mind for distributed systems.

## 11. Monitoring and Observability

- Implement application performance monitoring (APM).
- Use distributed tracing to track requests across services.
- Set up alerts for critical errors and performance thresholds.
- Implement proper metrics collection for system health and performance.

## 12. Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date README files for each service.
- Document system architecture and data flow.
- Keep API documentation in sync with the actual implementation.
- Document all configuration options and environment variables.

## 13. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

- Implement automated builds and tests for all pull requests.
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes.
- Implement automated deployment pipelines.
- Use infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform) for managing cloud resources.

## 14. Internationalization

- Use a translation management system for handling multilingual content.
- Implement locale-based routing for language-specific URLs.
- Use ICU message format for complex translations involving plurals and gender.

## 15. Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all user interfaces.
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
- Use ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- Regularly conduct accessibility audits.

These guidelines should help ensure a consistent, maintainable, and robust system. Remember to review and update these guidelines periodically as the system evolves and new best practices emerge.
