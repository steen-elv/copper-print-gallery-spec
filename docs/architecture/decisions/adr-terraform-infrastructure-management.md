# ADR: Use Terraform for Infrastructure Management in Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-07-31

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system requires a reliable and reproducible method for managing its infrastructure. While we've chosen Heroku as our primary deployment platform, we need a way to version control our infrastructure, manage multiple environments consistently, and potentially integrate with other cloud services (such as Amazon S3 for file storage).

## Decision
We have decided to use Terraform for managing the infrastructure of the Copper Print Gallery system, including our Heroku resources and any additional cloud services we integrate with.

## Rationale
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform allows us to define our infrastructure in a declarative manner, providing version control and reproducibility.
2. Multi-Cloud Support: While primarily using Heroku, Terraform allows us to easily integrate and manage resources from other providers (e.g., AWS for S3) in a unified manner.
3. Consistency Across Environments: Terraform makes it easier to maintain consistency between development, staging, and production environments.
4. State Management: Terraform's state management helps in tracking the current state of our infrastructure and managing changes over time.
5. Modularity: Terraform's module system allows us to create reusable components of our infrastructure, promoting best practices and reducing redundancy.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Version-controlled infrastructure, enabling easy tracking of changes and rollbacks if necessary.
- Improved consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
- Easier management of complex infrastructure as the system grows.
- Ability to automate infrastructure changes as part of our CI/CD pipeline.

### Negative
- Initial setup time to define our infrastructure in Terraform.
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with Terraform.
- Need to manage Terraform state securely.

### Risks
- Potential for configuration drift if manual changes are made outside of Terraform.
- Risk of exposing sensitive information if Terraform files are not properly secured.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Set up a Terraform project structure for the Copper Print Gallery system.
2. Define Terraform modules for common infrastructure components (e.g., Heroku apps, databases, S3 buckets).
3. Use Terraform to manage Heroku resources:
   - Heroku applications
   - Heroku add-ons (e.g., PostgreSQL)
   - Environment variables and configuration
4. Implement Terraform configurations for additional services like Amazon S3.
5. Set up a secure method for storing and accessing Terraform state (e.g., using a backend like S3 with encryption).
6. Integrate Terraform executions into our CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure updates.
7. Establish a review process for Terraform changes, similar to code reviews.
8. Document best practices for using Terraform in our project, including naming conventions and module structure.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Heroku CLI and Heroku.yml: Simpler but less powerful and not as suitable for managing resources outside of Heroku.
2. AWS CloudFormation: Powerful but primarily focused on AWS resources, less suitable for our Heroku-centric deployment.
3. Pulumi: Similar capabilities to Terraform but would require additional learning given our existing Terraform expertise.
