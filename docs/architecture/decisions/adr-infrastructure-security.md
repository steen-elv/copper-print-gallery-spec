# ADR: Infrastructure Security for Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-08-01

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system is deployed on Heroku with some AWS services. We need to ensure that the infrastructure is secure and follows best practices for cloud security.

## Decision
We will implement the following infrastructure security measures:

1. Heroku Security:
   - Enable Heroku's SSL/TLS features for all applications.
   - Use Heroku Private Spaces if budget allows, to isolate the application in its own network.
   - Enable Heroku Shield for additional security features if compliance requirements change in the future.

2. AWS Security:
   - Use IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing all AWS API calls.
   - Use VPC endpoints for S3 access to keep traffic within the AWS network.

3. Network Security:
   - Implement proper network security groups and firewall rules.
   - Use VPN or Direct Connect for secure administrative access if needed.

4. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Utilize Heroku's built-in logging and monitoring tools.
   - Implement log retention and analysis procedures.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities or system anomalies.

5. Patch Management:
   - Keep all system components up to date with the latest security patches.
   - Use Heroku's automatic updates for the platform components.
   - Implement a process for regular updates of custom code and dependencies.

6. Disaster Recovery:
   - Develop and maintain a disaster recovery plan.
   - Regularly test the disaster recovery procedures.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved overall security posture of the infrastructure.
- Better visibility into system activities and potential security issues.
- Increased resilience against common cloud security threats.

### Negative
- Increased complexity in infrastructure management.
- Potential for higher costs, especially if using advanced features like Heroku Private Spaces.

### Risks
- Over-restrictive security measures could impact system flexibility and ease of development.
- Regular updates and security patches could potentially introduce stability issues.

## Implementation Notes
- Document all security configurations and access policies.
- Conduct regular security audits of the infrastructure.
- Train the development team on secure cloud practices.
- Implement a change management process for infrastructure modifications.
