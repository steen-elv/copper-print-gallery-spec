# ADR: Data Protection for Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-08-01

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system stores sensitive data including artwork metadata and images. While the system doesn't collect user information except for the artist, it's crucial to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the stored data.

## Decision
We will implement the following data protection measures:

1. Encryption at Rest:
   - Enable encryption at rest for the PostgreSQL database using Heroku's built-in encryption.
   - Use server-side encryption for Amazon S3 buckets storing artwork images.

2. Secure Database Connections:
   - Enforce SSL/TLS connections to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Use connection pooling to manage database connections securely.

3. S3 Bucket Security:
   - Implement strict access controls on S3 buckets.
   - Use separate buckets for temporary storage of original images and processed images.
   - Enable versioning on S3 buckets to protect against accidental deletions.

4. Regular Backups:
   - Implement daily automated backups of the PostgreSQL database.
   - Store backups in a separate, secure S3 bucket with encryption.
   - Regularly test the restore process to ensure backup integrity.

5. Access Control:
   - Implement the principle of least privilege for all service accounts.
   - Regularly review and audit access permissions.

6. Data Retention and Deletion:
   - Implement a data retention policy for artwork data and images.
   - Create a secure process for data deletion when required.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced protection of sensitive artwork data and images.
- Reduced risk of data loss or unauthorized access.
- Improved compliance with data protection best practices.

### Negative
- Slight increase in operational complexity due to encryption and backup processes.
- Potential minor performance impact due to encryption.

### Risks
- Risk of data loss if backup and restore processes are not regularly tested.
- Potential for increased costs due to additional storage for backups and versioning.

## Implementation Notes
- Configure Heroku PostgreSQL to use the highest available encryption standard.
- Use AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for managing encryption keys for S3.
- Document the backup and restore process, including regular testing procedures.
- Implement monitoring for backup jobs and S3 bucket access.
