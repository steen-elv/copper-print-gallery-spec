# ADR: Authentication Security for Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-08-01

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system requires secure authentication for the artist to manage content. The system uses Auth0 as the authentication service, and we need to ensure that the implementation provides robust security for the artist account.

## Decision
We will implement the following authentication security measures:

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Enable MFA for the artist account in Auth0.
   - Require MFA for all logins to the Artist Web Application.

2. Strong Password Policy:
   - Enforce a strong password policy in Auth0 with the following requirements:
     - Minimum length of 12 characters
     - Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
     - Password expiration every 90 days
     - Prevent reuse of the last 5 passwords

3. Secure Token Handling:
   - Use short-lived JWT tokens (expiration of 1 hour) for API authentication.
   - Implement secure token storage in the Artist Web Application using HTTP-only, secure cookies.

4. Regular Credential Rotation:
   - Rotate Auth0 API keys and secrets every 90 days.
   - Implement a process for the artist to change their password regularly.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly enhanced security for the artist account.
- Reduced risk of unauthorized access to the content management system.
- Compliance with common security best practices.

### Negative
- Slightly increased complexity in the authentication process for the artist.
- Need for regular maintenance tasks (credential rotation).

### Risks
- Potential for the artist to be locked out if MFA device is lost (mitigated by providing backup codes).
- Increased support needs if the artist struggles with the enhanced security measures.

## Implementation Notes
- Coordinate with the artist to set up and test MFA.
- Document the process for credential rotation and ensure it's performed regularly.
- Provide clear instructions to the artist on password requirements and MFA setup.
