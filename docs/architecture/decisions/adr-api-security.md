# ADR: API Security for Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-08-01

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system exposes APIs for both public access to gallery content and authenticated access for the artist. We need to implement security measures to protect these APIs from potential threats and unauthorized access.

## Decision
We will implement the following API security measures:

1. HTTPS Encryption:
   - Enforce HTTPS for all API communications.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher.
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

2. API Authentication:
   - Use JWT tokens for API authentication for the artist.
   - Implement API key authentication for public API access (if needed in the future).

3. Rate Limiting:
   - Implement rate limiting in the API Gateway to prevent abuse.
   - Set appropriate limits based on expected usage patterns.

4. Input Validation and Sanitization:
   - Implement strict input validation for all API endpoints.
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

5. CORS Configuration:
   - Implement a strict CORS policy that only allows requests from trusted domains.

6. Security Headers:
   - Implement security headers including:
     - Content-Security-Policy
     - X-XSS-Protection
     - X-Frame-Options
     - X-Content-Type-Options

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced protection against common API vulnerabilities.
- Reduced risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Improved overall system security posture.

### Negative
- Slight increase in API response times due to additional security checks.
- Need for careful configuration to avoid disrupting legitimate API usage.

### Risks
- Overly restrictive security measures could impact system usability.
- Regular updates and monitoring required to maintain security effectiveness.

## Implementation Notes
- Configure rate limiting based on expected usage patterns, with the ability to adjust as needed.
- Regularly review and update the CORS policy and security headers.
- Implement logging for security-related events (e.g., failed authentication attempts, rate limit exceeded) for monitoring purposes.
