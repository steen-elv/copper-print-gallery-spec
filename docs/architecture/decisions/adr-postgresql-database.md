# ADR: Use PostgreSQL as Database for Copper Print Gallery

## Date
2024-07-31

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Copper Print Gallery system requires a reliable, robust, and scalable database solution to store and manage data related to artworks, galleries, and metadata. Given our small scale (less than 100 daily users, one artist) and potential for future growth, we need a database that can handle our current needs efficiently while allowing for future expansion.

## Decision
We have decided to use PostgreSQL as the primary database for the Copper Print Gallery system.

## Rationale
1. Reliability: PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and data integrity.
2. Feature-rich: Supports complex queries, full-text search, and JSON data types, which align well with our metadata management needs.
3. Scalability: Can handle our current small scale efficiently and can be scaled to support future growth.
4. Heroku Integration: Offers seamless integration with Heroku, our chosen deployment platform, through the Heroku Postgres add-on.
5. Open-source: Provides a strong community and extensive documentation.
6. ACID Compliance: Ensures data consistency and integrity, crucial for managing artwork and gallery information.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Robust data management capabilities out of the box.
- Strong support for complex queries and data relationships.
- Easy integration with our Heroku deployment.
- Potential for advanced features like full-text search if needed in the future.

### Negative
- May be slightly overqualified for our initial small-scale needs.
- Requires some specific knowledge for optimal performance tuning.

### Risks
- Potential performance issues if not properly optimized as the dataset grows.
- Possible need for database migration if our data needs dramatically change in the future.

## Implementation Notes
1. Use Heroku Postgres add-on for easy setup and management.
2. Implement database migrations for version control of our schema.
3. Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library compatible with PostgreSQL for easier data management in our application code.
4. Set up regular backups using Heroku's automated backup feature.
5. Monitor database performance using Heroku's dashboard and consider more advanced monitoring tools as we scale.

## Alternatives Considered
1. MySQL: Another popular open-source relational database, but PostgreSQL was preferred for its robust feature set and better handling of concurrent writes.
2. MongoDB: A NoSQL option that could handle flexible schemas well, but our data has a relatively stable structure that fits well with a relational model.
3. SQLite: While simple and lightweight, it lacks the robustness and concurrent access capabilities we might need as we grow.
